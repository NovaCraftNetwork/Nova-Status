# üåå Nova Status Bot

**Nova Status** is a highly configurable and easy-to-use Discord bot that allows you to display the status of your Minecraft server directly on Discord.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these simple steps to get your bot up and running:

1. **Fork or Download the Repository**  
To get started, either **fork** this repository to your GitHub account or **download** it as a ZIP file.

2. **Configure the `config.json` File**  
Open the `config.json` file and replace the placeholder values with your own details. Here‚Äôs an example configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
      "channelId": "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID",
      "serverIp": "YOUR_MINECRAFT_SERVER_IP"
    }
    ```

    - **token**: Your Discord bot‚Äôs token. You can generate this by creating a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    - **channelId**: The ID of the Discord channel where you want the server status to appear. To get the channel ID, enable "Developer Mode" in Discord settings and right-click the channel to copy its ID.
    - **serverIp**: The IP address of your Minecraft server.

    **Note**: If you're using a free hosting provider or testing locally, your bot‚Äôs node could be temporarily blocked due to too many requests or frequent restarts (typically 15-30 minutes). If this happens, try to wait or reduce the frequency of requests to avoid triggering rate limits.

3. **Install Dependencies**  
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all the necessary dependencies for your bot to function properly.

4. **Run the Bot**  
Start the bot by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    If everything is set up correctly, your bot should now be live and displaying your Minecraft server status in the specified Discord channel!

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Bot not posting status?**
    - Double-check your `config.json` for accuracy, especially the token, channel ID, and server IP.
    - Ensure your bot has permission to post in the designated channel.
    - **Temporary Block**: If your bot is temporarily blocked due to frequent requests or restarts, wait 15-30 minutes before trying again. Reducing the frequency of requests can help prevent this issue.

- **Getting errors on startup?**
    - Make sure all dependencies were installed correctly with `npm install`.
    - Verify that your version of Node.js is up-to-date (recommended version: v14 or higher).
