    - **`channelId`**: The ID of the Discord channel where the status should appear.
    - **`serverIp`**: The IP address of your Minecraft server.
    - **`enableExpress`**: Set to `true` if you want to monitor your bot with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).
    - **`port`**: Port number for the Express server (default is 3000).
    - **`checkInterval`**: How often (in milliseconds) to check the server status (default is 5 minutes).

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Bot not posting status?**
    - Double-check your `config.json` for accuracy, especially the token, channel ID, and server IP.
    - Ensure your bot has permission to post in the designated channel.
    - **Temporary Block**: If your bot is temporarily blocked due to frequent requests or restarts, wait 15-30 minutes before trying again. Reducing the frequency of requests can help prevent this issue.

- **Getting errors on startup?**
    - Make sure all dependencies were installed correctly with `npm install`.
    - Verify that your version of Node.js is up-to-date (recommended version: v14 or higher).
